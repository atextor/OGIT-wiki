1. What is GraphIT 
   1. short (exec summary) - 
   The goal of the OGIT (Open Graph of IT) Ontology Framework is to build an open semantic representation of 
   all IT and it's interactions with business process and people for providing a foundation for computational
   evaluation. The resulting knowledge graph allows to interconnect various IT Systems in the IT Operations 
   and IT Management space. While previous approaches like the IBM Common Data Model (CDM) required too much   
   details and did not allow any ambiguity and incorrectness, OGIT allows varying levels of details, accepts 
   incorrectness and supports different classes of data to allow proper handling from a computational 
   perspective. The ontology structure is designed for providing a common, best practice approach, thought 
   giving great flexibility and extensibility for every implementor.
