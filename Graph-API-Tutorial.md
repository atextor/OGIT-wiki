# Graph API Tutorial

This Tutorial shows you how to work with the API an how you can
put data into OGIT on the base of an example. In that example the REST interface will be used.

## The Service Example


## Creating NTO
First you have to create the NTO of the Service. A Service is an entity of global knowledge.
The Service NTO is shown here. https://github.com/arago/OGIT/tree/master/NTO/Service

## Authenticate
First you send us an email to register. You need the registration to authenticate against OGIT.

> REST (request)

    curl -X POST -H 'GraphIT-Version:4.2-SNAPSHOT' -H 'username:graphit-tutorial@arago.de' -H 'password:graphittutorial' 'https://graphit-test.arago.de/authenticate'
